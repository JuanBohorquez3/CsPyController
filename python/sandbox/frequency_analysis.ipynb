      "Saravana Bhavan doesn\u2019t look like a house of secrets. Its dining room at the corner of Lexington Avenue and 26th Street is clean and bright and often attracts a line out front. It doesn\u2019t advertise because it doesn\u2019t need to; the fact that it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s largest chains of vegetarian restaurants \u2014 33 in India, another 47 in a dozen other countries \u2014 is considered too obvious to its core clientele of Indian expatriates and tourists to be worth trumpeting. In a city overwhelmed with underwhelming north Indian food, Saravana Bhavan is the standard-bearer of the delicacies of the south, but it makes no effort to educate the uninitiated. If you don\u2019t know what a dosa is or how to eat it, you\u2019re on your own.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man behind the chain is an elusive 66-year-old named P. Rajagopal. Among his peers in the restaurant business in Chennai, the south Indian city where Saravana Bhavan is headquartered, Rajagopal is a legend. \u201cHe brought prestige to the vegetarian business,\u201d said a restaurateur named Manoharan, who runs a competing chain called Murugan Idli. \u201cHe made a revolution.\u201d\n",

      "Born into a low caste in a remote province, he came to rule a field that was once the sole domain of Brahmins, cleverly updating their traditional fare in a setting that was both respectable and unpretentious, thereby catering to India\u2019s middle class at just the moment it emerged. Today he employs more than 8,000 people in Chennai alone. His workers enjoy benefits fantastic enough for Silicon Valley (pensions, TVs, education), inspiring among them fierce loyalty to Rajagopal. Every day thousands of pilgrims come to pray at the temples he built in the village of his birth, and a hundred thousand come to eat in his restaurants.\n",
      "\n",
      "His business model is so seemingly foolproof that the company has acquired an air of invincibility, even as its founder became sullied with scandal. As Saravana Bhavan went global, Rajagopal was charged with murder, found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. Yet he served a total of only 11 months, and today he\u2019s free to continue his expansion \u2014 next stop Hong Kong, followed by Sydney, Australia. And then, if his health holds out, building his first luxury hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saravana Bhavan specializes in the holy trinity of south Indian snacks known as tiffin: dosa, idli and vada. All are made from ground rice and lentils, with remarkably different results. Dosas are crispy golden crepes that are most deliciously served with a masala of potato and onion; vadas are deep-fried savory doughnuts; and idlis, the south\u2019s staple food, are pure-white saucer-shaped steamed cakes. At most branches of Saravana Bhavan in Chennai, you can also find for sale a little book titled, \u201cI Set My Heart on Victory.\u201d First published in 1997, the book is Rajagopal\u2019s memoir and manifesto, a curious blend of mythmaking and self-effacement.\n",

      "His story begins in 1947, 10 days before India\u2019s independence from the British, when he was born in the vast brushland in the southern state Tamil Nadu. His village, Punnaiadi, was so inconsequential that it didn\u2019t merit a bus stop; his home was a shack with mud-and-cow-dung floors. Rajagopal writes that he quit school after seventh grade, left home alone and took a job wiping tables at a cheap restaurant in a distant resort town, where he showered in a waterfall and slept on the kitchen floor. But he was proud of his work, especially after the restaurant\u2019s tea master inducted him into the mysteries of making a perfect chai.\n",
      "\n",
      "Continue reading the main story\n",
      "When he was a teenager, he moved to Chennai, then known as Madras, and in 1968 opened the first in a series of tiny groceries on the outskirts of the city. One day in 1979, at his grocery in a neighborhood called KK Nagar, a salesman made a casual remark: He\u2019d have to go all the way to T Nagar for lunch because KK Nagar didn\u2019t have any restaurants.\n",
      "\n",
      "A century ago, there were virtually no restaurants in all of Chennai. \u201cIt\u2019s a country that was very conservative about eating out,\u201d said Krishnendu Ray, a food-studies professor at N.Y.U. When Rajagopal was born, the restaurant scene consisted of little more than Brahmin hotels: modest affairs catering to the traveling upper caste, whose dietary rules dictated that they couldn\u2019t eat food cooked by any caste but their own. As a member of the Nadar caste, Rajagopal wouldn\u2019t have been allowed to eat in most Brahmin hotels, let alone run one. But by the time he came of age, entrepreneurs from other castes had begun to meet Chennai\u2019s increasing appetite for dining out.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was little to suggest that Rajagopal was ready to join them. When he opened his debut restaurant in KK Nagar in 1981, his struggling shops had left him deep in debt, and he knew little about food service beyond selling groceries. He made the leap, he told me, only after an astrologer recommended that he try a line of work that involved fire. A business adviser insisted that he should use cheap ingredients and pay his staff as little as possible; food workers are vagabonds, he said, and they\u2019ll take what they can get. \u201cI did not like his argument at all,\u201d Rajagopal writes in his memoir. He fired the adviser, started using coconut oil and top-quality vegetables and gave his workers surprisingly high wages. The business lost 10,000 rupees a month \u2014 a big deficit for a restaurant where most items on the menu sold for a rupee apiece.\n",
      "\n",
      "But word spread that his food was tasty and cheap, and soon Rajagopal was turning a profit and opening new branches. He expanded his workers\u2019 benefits, all of them unprecedented in Indian restaurants: free health care, housing stipends, a marriage fund for their daughters. Saravana Bhavan workers started calling him Annachi, a Tamil term of respect that means \u201celder brother.\u201d\n",

      "By the \u201890s, a Saravana Bhavan could be found in neighborhoods throughout Chennai. Locals sometimes refer to the brand as their version of McDonald\u2019s: well lit, ubiquitous and uncannily consistent. Unlike McDonald\u2019s, the restaurants make everything from scratch. One afternoon, a trio of bright-eyed assistants from the company\u2019s R & D department gave me a tour of the branch in Mylapore, a Chennai neighborhood. I was surprised to find that there were no freezers, just a single walk-in cooler for vegetables that had been bought at market the day before. Even the rice flour for the dosas was ground on the premises.\n",
      "\n",

      "In 2000, Saravana Bhavan branched out for the first time beyond India, opening a franchise in Dubai, where Indian expats vastly outnumber native-born Emiratis. According to Rajagopal\u2019s elder son, Shiva Kumaar, the opening-day crowd was like \u201cfor a newly released movie.\u201d They\u2019d eventually expand to Paris, Frankfurt, London, Dallas and Doha, Qatar. The strategy is simple: open one restaurant in every city with a large expat Indian population. (One exception is Manhattan, which has two.) Prey on homesickness by importing skilled chefs to ensure that the food tastes just the way it does in Chennai. Don\u2019t bother trying to pursue non-Indian customers.\n",

      "In 2002, the year that he opened franchises in Singapore and Sunnyvale, Calif., Rajagopal was charged with murdering the husband of a woman he wanted to marry. In 2003, his restaurant expanded to Canada, Oman and Malaysia, and he went to jail for the first time. In 2004, a local Chennai court sentenced him to 10 years in prison. By the end of that year, the empire had opened 29 branches worldwide.\n",

      "Eight months into his prison term, the Supreme Court suspended Rajagopal\u2019s sentence on medical grounds while awaiting appeal, citing his diabetes. In 2009, the Madras High Court not only upheld the verdict but also upgraded the conviction from culpable homicide to murder and enhanced his sentence to life in prison. After another three-month stint, he was out on bail pending a Supreme Court hearing, which no one expects to happen anytime soon. The courts won\u2019t give him back his passport, but otherwise he\u2019s free to go about his life.

As one Saravana Bhavan loyalist told me: \u201cSome of my friends used to say, How can you go and eat in his restaurant? You\u2019re actually fattening the wallet of a murderer. And I used to tell them, Look, I don\u2019t know with whom I do business in my day-to-day activity, whether he\u2019s a drunk or beats his wife. I have no idea, but I do business.

Don\u2019t act funny, I know he\u2019s inside.\u2019 There was a boy pouring water, and he told them: \u2018You\u2019re talking about my boss.

      "One gloomy Wednesday evening in August, I went to meet Rajagopal at Saravana Bhavan\u2019s headquarters, passing several of his restaurants as I inched my way through the city\u2019s eternal gridlock. Mahadevan met me in the dining room and escorted me to the boss\u2019s office, introducing me on the way to Rajagopal\u2019s 39-year-old son, Saravanan, who is gradually taking over the company\u2019s domestic operations. (His elder brother, Shiva Kumaar, runs the international business.) For a while the three of us sat and stared at the walls: Every surface was covered with blown-up images of Rajagopal\u2019s family and favorite Hindu deities. Then suddenly Mahadevan and Saravanan rose. The office door swung open, and Rajagopal entered.\n",

      "He was grayer and jowlier than he was in the photographs I\u2019d seen. He regarded the room with mild amusement, bowed politely and walked behind his desk, where he faced a portrait of a popular guru and folded his hands for a moment of prayer. With him was Ganapathi Iyer, his oldest friend, and a personal assistant and a valet. We all sat but the valet, who stood ready with a glass of water the instant his boss coughed. Nobody relaxed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked Rajagopal about his origins and business philosophy. Each question was answered with a cascade of replies: Rajagopal would answer in Tamil, then Saravanan or Mahadevan or Iyer or all three would jump in to elaborate or clarify in English, a language Rajagopal doesn\u2019t understand. It was a dynamic that sometimes clearly frustrated the boss.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I asked about the murder, everyone started talking at once, until Rajagopal cut impatiently through the chatter. \u201cI\u2019m not responsible for anyone\u2019s death,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to pray to my god, why was I punished for someone else\u2019s mistake?\u201d There was a reason, he decided: \u201cGod wanted to give an opportunity for my son Saravanan to learn business.\u201d Saravanan smiled faintly.\n",

In the foyer outside his office, eight employees were standing in line waiting to speak with him. An older man with a handlebar mustache and a proud bearing told me that he was a night watchman and was there to ask Rajagopal for a promotion. Another said he hoped to be transferred to a different branch. A third said he wanted to inform Rajagopal of his coming wedding.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went back into Rajagopal\u2019s office. He sat at his desk, studying a spreadsheet with the aid of a magnifying glass. He consulted his assistant and then called in the first man. Rajagopal ignored him and barked into a walkie-talkie, asking the voice on the other end what had brought in this man who stood before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the walkie-talkie came a surprising answer: \u201cThey keep fighting the whole night.\u201d That was not what he told me outside. The man hung his head. Rajagopal fired him on the spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next man came in, and another voice on the walkie-talkie told Rajagopal that he\u2019d been fiddling with his cellphone in the dining room. It turned out that nearly all the employees in line had lied to me; they were there to be disciplined.\n",

      "According to the document, Rajagopal \u2014 possibly on the advice of his astrologer \u2014 became determined to marry Jeevajothi, the young daughter of one of his assistant managers. That would have made her Rajagopal\u2019s third simultaneous wife: In 1972, he married the mother of his sons, and in 1994, he married the wife of one of his employees.\n",

In 1999, Jeevajothi and Santhakumar eloped, but Rajagopal\u2019s fixation persisted; he gave her jewelry, dresses and several installments of cash to help her open a travel agency. While Jeevajothi accepted the gifts, she continued to resist Rajagopal\u2019s advances. On Sept. 28, 2001, Rajagopal came to Jeevajothi and Santhakumar\u2019s house at midnight and warned Santhakumar that he had two days to sever their relationship. He told Jeevajothi that his second wife, too, had at first rejected him, but now she was living \u201ca queen life.\u201d\n",

      "The young couple tried to flee to a place where they hoped Rajagopal wouldn\u2019t find them, but five of Rajagopal\u2019s employees, led by a restaurant manager named Daniel, intercepted them. The henchmen forced the couple into an Ambassador car and drove them to a Saravana Bhavan warehouse in KK Nagar, where Rajagopal appeared. According to the court\u2019s narrative, Rajagopal hiked up his dhoti and gave Santhakumar a beating. Jeevajothi fell at Rajagopal\u2019s feet and begged him to stop. Rajagopal told his men to take Santhakumar to the next room and continue beating him. Jeevajothi sat in the corner and wept.\n",

Instead, they went to the city police commissioner\u2019s office to file a complaint. Six days later, Rajagopal\u2019s employees kidnapped the couple again and forcibly separated them.

Then he interrogated Daniel about what happened to Santhakumar. Daniel lied and said that he had tied him up on a railway track, where a train ran him over, and then he burned his clothes. With a dramatic flourish, Rajagopal then called Santhakumar into the room. Who\u2019s this then, he asked Daniel, Santhakumar\u2019s ghost? Daniel started beating Santhakumar there in the office, enraged that he\u2019d revealed his betrayal of Rajagopal. Jeevajothi and her family tried to intervene.

An assistant surgeon at the local hospital concluded in his post-mortem that the cause of Santhakumar\u2019s death was \u201casphyxia due to throttling.\u201d The police later found the alleged murder weapon \u2014 a sarong \u2014 under the seat of Daniel\u2019s car.\n",

In the middle of the red-dirt moonscape, Rajagopal has erected a surreal monument to his success, in the form of a four-acre Saravana Bhavan campus. The centerpiece is a million-dollar Hindu temple, which is flanked by a Saravana Bhavan restaurant that employs 140 people \u2014 all for a village that has fewer than 90 homes.\n",

      "As the company continues to grow, manpower is a worry. Saravanan said he is committed to making everything from fresh ingredients \u2014 in fact, he wants to take it further, and he has been experimenting with replacing the artificial stabilizer in Saravana\u2019s otherwise all-natural house-brand ice cream with flaxseed. But such cooking requires vast kitchen staffs, and as better education reaches more and more Indians, he said, fewer workers are interested in that kind of labor.\n",

      "One solution Saravanan likes is automation. Another in-house lab is developing prototypes for everything from coffee machines to vada fryers, according to Saravana Bhavan\u2019s very particular specifications. He recognizes, though, that the mass utility of such machines is still years away; in the meantime, personnel remains the company\u2019s most treasured asset, so he has also systematized the hiring process. An in-house medical team records each applicant\u2019s vital statistics using software Saravanan developed. A coffee man, he explained, should be small and quiet, while a dosa chef needs to be at least 5-foot-6.\n",
