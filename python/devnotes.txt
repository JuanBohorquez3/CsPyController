CsController2 notes:

current question:
    waveform upload error

TODO:
    compressedGenerate
    tick all channels on waveform y-axis, label x-axis as "samples" and limit to integer ticks?
    save settings to HDF5
    make it so that the TCP connection is labeled as uninitialized on an error
    remove git_repos_old on hexagon
    replace other indexed Stacks with IndexedStack
    It would be nice to make the variable reporting format able to handle line breaks somehow.  Maybe parse each line separately.
    Add optimization
    Add + Page to waveform notebooks, which is not closeable, and on showing, acts to open a new waveform.
    horizontal scroll bar doesn't appear when too many transitions are added to waveform
    make it so that RangeProp high and low could be re-assigned to None dynamically if desired (without raising error, unless value is outside that range)
    make it so that BoolProps get evaluated on instantiation, don't wait for settings to be loaded, because that may never happen, function passed on initialization should be valid (or provide default behavior), could make alternate valueText if that is useful
    get red box validation display working
    make analog output graph update on add new equation or delete equation
    send AO equations is compressed form
    fix float divide by zero error on AnalogOutput initial evaluate
    implement "hardware" flag on Prop to control what gets sent to hardware and what doesn't (default to True)
    improve handling of TCP disconnect/reconnect
    implement settimeout instead of setblocking for TCP communication with timeout equal to experiment timeout or shorter
    clean out unnecessary files in LabView section
    use http://olgabot.github.io/prettyplotlib/ ?
    change LabView demo data to be a more flexible "echo" from python, would be useful for running analysis tests
    add useless 2013 style files

Done:
    return error and log from LabView initialization
    Make hexagon not read-only so I can push git to there
    Add instruments to backend and detail to front panel
    make waveform plotting even faster by changing data in plot objects, instead of creating new ones.
    make python and labview both able to interpret 'false' and 'False' and '0' and '' as False
    Fill in the rest of the instruments
    Send real experiment settings back and forth
    make all XML protocol good, and match between LabView and python
    add results to an hdf5 object as they come in, each gets put into experiment.results[measurement_number]['name'] after some proper dissection
    'MESG'+4 byte total length + 4 byte name length + name + 4 byte data length + data
    Got analog output graph to display, now put the right equations in it
    XML can't handle just a number as a tag, apparently.  WHY?!!!  Make it so XML tags for list elements start with a word, then number
    update HSDIO and DDS to use ListProp
    make a method that rescans all the variables, to make sure everything is updated from XML?
    on load refresh waveforms (or everything?)
    working on fromXML in Waveforms
    how to deal with iterables in the XML.  Probably look for hasattr(__iter__).  
    add ability to remove a transition
    closed waveforms should be removed.
    add graph to waveform listing
    Convert waveform table to HSDIO loadable format
    add channel info to waveform listing
    make sure everything gets updated appropriately
    -add explicit update to experiment run
    Need to make sure we don't pickle anything that has
        references back to experiment, because that is happening right now and we get a LOOOONG file.
    hot on the trail of a good XML solution, I decided pickling is okay for individual elements, within an XML framework
    
Scratch notes:
    updating ivar function on GUI recalculates that one ivar but nothing else.  Hitting the evaluate button does experiment.evaluateAll()
